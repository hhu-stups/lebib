  ABSTRACT = {<b>Localization</b> Localization is the process of determining the rigid-body translations and rotations that must be performed on a set of points measured on a manufactured surface (like a propeller blade) to move those points into the closest correspondence with the ideal design surface. An additional parameter is an offset distance, such that the Euclidean motion brings the measured points as close as possible to an offset of the design surface. An algorithm to determine the seven parameters (three rotations, three translations, one offset) was developed in 1991 by R. A. Jinkerson. But that algorithm makes some assumptions about the surface and the measured points, which are sometimes not fulfilled. Specifically, it assumes, that a measured point has always an orthogonal projection on the offset surface, regardless of the translation and rotation parameters. This thesis extends Jinkerson's algorithm, so that these assumptions are not necessary any longer. This involves the development of a new objective function and its gradient.<br><br> <b>Feature extraction</b> During the manufacturing process, a propeller blade surface is subject to manufacturing inaccuracies, that result in small changes to the data describing its features. It is therefore desirable to recompute these features for comparison with the original design data. Most of the characteristics of a propeller blade are embedded in the camber lines of its hydrofoil sections. The objective of this part of the thesis is to recompute the camber line from a hydrofoil shape curve. An algorithm for this task has already been developed, but it makes the assumption that the blade thickness has a single maximum, which is often not fulfilled, especially, if the hydrofoil has been generated from measured data. In this thesis, a new algorithm has been developed. It generates a highly accurate camber line by using a two pass iteration method: The first pass generates an approximation of the camber line, and the second pass refines this approximation to the desired accuracy.},

@THESIS{Ha97_302,
  ABSTRACT = {CSP-Z ist eine Sprache zur Spezifikation zustandsbasierter kommunizierender Systeme, welche die Prozeßalgebra CSP und die Z-Notation zusammenführt. Die Semantik von CSP-Z-Spezifikationen wird durch das Failures/Divergences-Modell von CSP beschrieben, das von Roscoe angepaßt wurde, um unbeschränkten Nichtdetermismus besser behandeln zu können. Für CSP gibt es eine Verfeinerungstheorie, die auf dem Failures/Divergences-Modell basiert. Diese Theorie lässt sich in einfacher Weise auf CSP-Z übertragen. Ziel dieser Arbeit ist es die existierende Verfeinerungstheorie von Z für CSP-Z nutzbar zu machen. Mit Z können Datentypen prädikativ beschrieben werden, die nicht oder nur mit großem Aufwand zu implementieren sind. Doch bieten diese Datentypen den Vorteil, daß sie zu leichter verständlichen Spezifikationen führen, da bei starker Abstraktion viele für die Funktionalität des zu entwickelnden Programms unwesentliche Details wegfallen. Zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt werden jedoch besser implementierbare Datentypen benötigt. Es ist in Z möglich, einen (abstrakten) Datentypen durch einen anderen (konkreten) Datentypen zu ersetzen, so daß Programme, die bei Verwendung des abstrakten Datentypen korrekt waren, es auch bei Verwendung des konkreten Datentypen bleiben. Dieses Verfahren heißt Datenverfeinerung. Als Beweismethode zum Nachweis einer Datenverfeinerung dient die Simulation. Bis zu einem gewissen Grade lässt sich die Datenverfeinerungstheorie auch im Zusammenhang mit unsichtbaren Operationen verwenden, die durch Hiding entstehen. Es werden einige Regeln entwickelt, die auf den Regeln zur Datenverfeinerung in Z basieren und benutzt werden können, um Simulationsbeziehungen zwischen CSP-Z-Spezifikationen zu beweisen. Die Anwendung der entwickelten Regeln wird anhand kleinerer Fallstudien veranschaulicht.},

  ABSTRACT = {An abstract model of an industrial distributed data base application has been studied using process based, state based, and queueing theory based methods. The methods supported by graphical notations and/or integrated development environments were found to be easiest to work with. The methods supported by model checkers were the most successful in obtaining relevant information about the application. Applying a number of different methods to study one particular model encourages a problem to be viewed from different angles. This gives complementary information about the model. We report on a variety of problems of the model found through various routes. Our main conclusion is that asking experts to apply different methods and tools at a sufficiently abstract level can be done effectively revealing a broad range of information about the considered application.},

In this paper a conventional refinement approach is extended with a means for performance analysis. This new approach guides a developer towards well-performing implementations throughout the refinement process. The main achievement of this work is an elaboration of a connection between performance and trace refinement.},

  ABSTRACT = {Partial deduction is a source-to-source technique for specialising logic programs. This is (mostly) done by a well-automated application of parts of the Burstall and Darlington unfold/fold transformation framework. One of the main challenges of partial deduction is automatic control, which has to ensure correctness, efficiency, and termination. In this survey and tutorial, we present the essential developments over the past 10 years, and discuss their respective merits and shortcomings. We also present the current state of the art and discuss areas where further research is needed to enable more widespread practical use of partial deduction and realise its potential as a tool for systematic program development.},

  ABSTRACT = {In recent work it has been shown that infinite state model checking can be performed by a combination of partial deduction of logic programs and abstract interpretation. It has also been shown that partial deduction is powerful enough to mimic certain algorithms to decide coverability properties of Petri nets. These algorithms are forward algorithms and hard to scale up to deal with more complicated systems. Recently, it has been proposed to use a backward algorithm scheme instead. This scheme is applicable to so--called well--structured transition systems and was successfully used, e.g., to solve coverability problems for reset Petri nets. In this paper, we discuss how partial deduction can mimic many of these backward algorithms as well. We prove this link in particular for reset Petri nets and Petri nets with transfer and doubling arcs. We thus establish a surprising link between algorithms in Petri net theory and program specialisation, and also shed light on the power of using logic program specialisation for infinite state model checking.},

  ABSTRACT = {In recent work it has been shown that infinite state model checking can be performed by a combination of partial deduction of logic programs and abstract interpretation. This paper focuses on one particular class of problem--coverability for (infinite state) Petri nets--and shows how existing techniques and tools for declarative programs can be successfully applied. In particular, we show that a restricted form of partial deduction is already powerful enough to decide all coverability properties of Petri Nets. We also prove that two particular instances of partial deduction exactly compute the Karp-Miller tree as well as Finkel's minimal coverability set. We thus establish an interesting link between algorithms for Petri nets and logic program specialisation.},

These techniques have proved remarkably successful, and have been used to move from sequential to parallel codes, or to improve efficiency of existing parallel codes. Our research focuses on Fortran code optimisation for parallelisation in Shared Memory architectures by using data analysis and loop source-to-source transformations. Our optimisation strategy, although designed for OpenMP directives, is sufficiently general to be used for pure Fortran code. Our algorithm has been implemented as a tool called Automatic Guidance Module (AGM), and have received high evaluation scores from our industrial partners},

@THESIS{Ha01_301,
  ABSTRACT = {We introduce the probabilistic action system formalism which combines refinement with performance. Performance is expressed by means of probability and expected costs. Probability is needed to express uncertainty present in physical environments. Expected costs express physical or abstract quantities that describe a system. They encode the performance objective. The behaviour of probabilistic action systems is described by traces of expected costs. Corresponding notions of refinement and simulation-based proof rules are introduced. Formal notations like B or action systems support a notion of refinement. Refinement relates an abstract specification AA to a more deterministic concrete specification CC. Knowing AA and CC one proves CC refines, or implements, specification AA. In this study we consider specification AA as given and concern ourselves with a way to find a good candidate for implementation CC. To this end we classify all implementations of an abstract specification according to their performance. The performance of a specification AA is a value val.AA associated with some optimal behaviour it may exhibit. We distinguish performance from correctness. Concrete systems that do not meet the abstract specification are excluded. Only the remaining correct implementations CC are considered with respect to their performance. A good implementation of a specification is identified by having some optimal behaviour in common with it. In other words, a good refinement corresponds to a reduction of non-optimal behaviour. This also means that the abstract specification sets a boundary val.AA for the performance of any implementation. An implementation may perform worse than its specification but never better. Probabilistic action systems are based on discrete-time Markov decision processes. Numerical methods solving the optimisation problems posed by Markov decision processes are well-known, and used in a software tool that we have developed. The tool computes an optimal behaviour of a specification AA, and the associated value val.AA, thus assisting in the search for a good implementation CC. We present examples and case studies to demonstrate the use of probabilistic action systems.},

We show that to verify the abstractions generated by Ecce we may employ the proof assistant Isabelle.

Then, in many cases, Isabelle can automatically execute these proof scripts and thereby verify the soundness of Ecce's abstraction.

  ABSTRACT = {In this paper we discuss the similarities between program specialisation and inductive theorem proving, and then show how program specialisation can be used to perform inductive theorem proving. We then study this relationship in more detail for a particular class of problems (verifying infinite state Petri nets) in order to establish a clear link between program specialisation and inductive theorem proving. In particular, we use the program specialiser Ecce to generate specifications, hypotheses and proof scripts in the theory format of the proof assistant Isabelle. Then, in many cases, Isabelle can automatically execute these proof scripts and thereby verify the soundness of Ecce's verification process and of the correspondence between program specialisation and inductive theorem proving.},

ProB's animation facilities allow users to gain confidence in their specifications, and unlike the animator provided by the B-Toolkit, the user does not have to guess the right values for the operation arguments or choice variables. ProB contains a model checker and a constraint-based checker, both of which can be used to detect various errors in B specifications.

Specific objectives include efforts at integration as well as the transfer of methods between different groups from academia and industry. The topics are to be interpreted broadly and inclusively, and in particular cover all aspects of verification (model checking, theorem proving, specification and refinement proofs, etc) pertaining to various types of critical systems, be it safety-critical, business-critical, or performance-critical.<br/> The first meeting, AVoCS'01, was held in Oxford (UK), continuing in the tradition of the annual DERA/OUCL series. The second meeting, AVoCS'02, was held in Birmingham (UK). <br/> Similarly to previous years, the meeting will be informal, and will combine invited lectures with accepted submissions. This year we also want to aim for wider, European and international attention.<br/> Available online at: http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~mal/avocs03/},

  ABSTRACT = {Compositional Verification is a viable way to tackle the state explosion problem. However, the decomposition of a system into smaller parts is not a trivial problem, and dividing the specification into modules can be regarded as one of the main issues that concerns a compositional approach. This paper concentrates on the application of compositional verification to state-based models, in order to reduce the number of nodes assigned to memory, thus avoiding state explosion and speeding up the verification. Furthermore, we investigate and propose an estimation method that improves the compositional verification process in modular designs, such that the amount of memory required by the process is minimised. This method has been applied to a real-life embedded system, producing meaningful results without the need of data abstraction.},

The meta-program is implemented in Prolog and takes as input a database and an access policy specification. We then proceed to specialise the meta-program for a given access policy and intensional database by using the Logen partial evaluation system. In addition to describing the programs involved in our approach, we give a number of performance measures for our implementation of an access control checker, and we discuss the implications of using this approach for access control on deductive databases. In particular, we show that by using our approach we get flexible access control with virtually zero overhead.},

  ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a self-applicable partial evaluator for a considerable subset of full Prolog. The partial evaluator is shown to achieve non-trivial specialisation and be effectively self-applied. The attempts to self-apply partial evaluators for logic programs have, of yet, not been all that successful. Compared to earlier attempts, our LIX system is practically usable in terms of efficiency and can handle natural logic programming examples with partially static data structures, built-ins, side-effects, and some higher-order and meta-level features such as call and findall.<br/> The LIX system is derived from the development of the LOGEN compiler generator system. It achieves a similar kind of efficiency and specialisation, but can be used for other applications. Notably, we show first attempts at using the system for deforestation and tupling in an offline fashion. We will demonstrate that, contrary to earlier beliefs, declarativeness and the use of the ground representation is not the best way to achieve self-applicable partial evaluators.},

  ABSTRACT = {Recently the relationship between abstract interpretation and program specialization has received a lot of scrutiny, and the need has been identified to extend program specialization techniques so to make use of more refined abstract domains and operators. This paper clarifies this relationship in the context of logic programming, by expressing program specialization in terms of abstract interpretation. Based on this, a novel specialization framework, along with generic correctness results for computed answers and finite failure under SLD-resolution, is developed.<br/> This framework can be used to extend existing logic program specialization methods, such as partial deduction and conjunctive partial deduction, to make use of more refined abstract domains. It is also shown how this opens up the way for new optimizations. Finally, as shown in the paper, the framework also enables one to prove correctness of new or existing specialization techniques in a simpler manner.<br/> The framework has already been applied in the literature to develop and prove correct specialization algorithms using regular types, which in turn have been applied to the verification of infinite state process algebras.},

  ABSTRACT = {The development of formal models is often a key step when developing safety or mission critical software. In this setting it is vital to formally check and validate these formal models before translating them into code. I will present ProB, a toolset for the B method which was developed using constraint logic programming technology. ProB allows fully automatic animation of B models, and can be used to systematically check a B model for errors. ProB supports B features such as non-deterministic operations, ANY statements, operations with complex arguments, sets, sequences, functions, lambda abstractions, set comprehensions, constants and properties, and many more. ProB's animation facilities allow users to gain confidence in their specifications, and unlike other animators, the user does not have to guess the right values for the operation arguments or choice variables. This is achieved by using co-routining and finite domain constraint solving. On top of the animation features, ProB contains a temporal model checker and a constraint-based model checker, both of which can be used to detect various errors in B specifications.},

  ABSTRACT = {The so called "cogen" approach'' to program specialisation, writing a compiler generator instead of a specialiser, has been used with considerable success in partial evaluation of both functional and imperative languages. This paper demonstrates that the "cogen" approach is also applicable to the specialisation of logic programs (called partial deduction when applied to pure logic programs) and leads to effective specialisers. Moreover, using good binding-time annotations, the speed-ups of the specialised programs are comparable to the speed-ups obtained with online specialisers.<br/> The paper first develops a generic approach to offline partial deduction and then a specific offline partial deduction method, leading to the offline system LIX for pure logic programs. While this is a usable specialiser by itself, its specialisation strategy is used to develop the "cogen" system LOGEN. Given a program, a specification of what inputs will be static, and an annotation specifying which calls should be unfolded, LOGEN generates a specialised specialiser for the program at hand. Running this specialiser with particular values for the static inputs results in the specialised program. While this requires two steps instead of one, the efficiency of the specialisation process is improved in situations where the same program is specialised multiple times.<br/> The paper also presents and evaluates an automatic binding-time analysis that is able to derive the annotations. While the derived annotations are still suboptimal compared to hand-crafted ones, they enable non-expert users to use the LOGEN system in a fully automated way.<br/> Finally, LOGEN is extended so as to directly support a large part of Prolog's declarative and non-declarative features and so as to be able to perform so called mixline specialisations. In mixline specialisation some unfolding decisions depend on the outcome of tests performed at specialisation time instead of being hardwired into the specialiser.},

  ABSTRACT = {ProB is an animator and model checker for the B method. It also allows to visualise the state space of a B machine in graphical way. This is often very useful and allows users to quickly spot whether the machine behaves as expected. However, for larger state spaces the visualisation quickly becomes difficult to grasp by users (and the computation of the graph layout takes considerable time). In this paper we present two relatively simple algorithms to often considerably reduce the complexity of the graphs, while still keeping relevant information. This makes it possible to visualise much larger state spaces and gives the user immediate feedback about the overall behaviour of a machine. The algorithms have been implemented within the ProB toolset and we highlight their potential on several examples. We also conduct a thorough experimentation of the algorithm on 47 B machines and analyse the results.},

  ABSTRACT = {This report is deliverable WP4-01 of the project ??Trusted Software Agents and Services for Pervasive Information Environments.? The deliverable reports on the activities of formal modelling and verification of a pervasive application which follows from previous results in the project.<br/> The pervasive application is based on several pervasive scenarios already devised and is centred on the user location. This location-based system is first architecturally simplified, while trust requirements are derived from the Trust Analysis Framework presented in the deliverable WP2-01.<br/> This first abstraction is then completed by formal modelling of the system in the B formal method. These models enable us to clarify the decision decisions leading to fulfil the trust requirements. We show that the system policy structure is influenced by the priorities given to the system operations and that a sufficiently high level of abstraction is required to model trust properties.<br/> The modelling activity is completed by formal verification using the ProB model-checker to automate part of this process. Several models are checked successfully, while detection of errors in other models enables us to understand better the behaviour of the system. In particular, issues relative to the dynamicity of modelled elements are highlighted.<br/> The overall methodology followed during these activities proved useful at helping us specifying accurately the trust requirements, so that the pervasive application can be completed in consequence, and is as follows:<br/> 1) Model important features of the system First vaguely type the variables; then write a set of operations corresponding to complementary features while (possibly) modifying the variable types to ease this writing; consider the variables by group of similar dynamic properties;<br/> 2a) Model-check the model<br/> 2a.a) Property violation detected Examine the various aspects of the model (variables, enabled operations, history of operations) to see what part of the property is ??false?; Correct the model accordingly;<br/> 2a.b) No property violation detected Go back to 2a until coverage rate is enough; possible changes to the model include: modify the initialisation to test other situations (in B use ??choice by predicate?); add inconsistencies in the model;<br/> 2b) Animate the model<br/> 2b.a) Execute the desired sequence of operations (validation);<br/> 2b.b) Find an interesting state, then 2a.a or 2a.b applies;<br/> 2b.c) Backtrack from a state where the invariant is violated;<br/> 3) Go back to 1 (complete the model) or refine the model.},

  ABSTRACT = {Object Petri nets (OPNs) provide a natural and modular method for the modelling of many real-world systems. We give a structure-preserving translation of OPNs to Prolog, avoiding the need for an unfolding to a flat Petri net. The translation provides support for reference and value semantics, and even allows different objects to be treated as copyable or non-copyable, respectively. The method is developed for OPNs with arbitrary nesting. <br/> We then apply logic programming tools to animate, compile and model check OPNs. In particular, we use the partial evaluation system LOGEN to produce an OPN compiler, and we use the model checker XTL to verify CTL formulas. We also use LOGEN to produce special purpose model checkers. <br/> We present two case studies, along with experimental results. A comparison to OPN translations to MAUDE specifications and model checking is given, showing that our approach is roughly twice as fast for larger systems. We also tackle infinite state model checking using the ECCE system.},

  ABSTRACT = {The approach proposed in this paper introduces a hardware/software co-design framework for developing complex embedded systems. The method relies on formal proof of system properties at every phase of the co-design cycle. The key concept is the combined use of UML and the B language for system modeling and design, and the seamless transition from UML specifications to system descriptions in B. The final system prototype emerges from correct-by-construction subsystems described in the B language; the hardware components are translated in VHDL/SystemC, while for the software components C/C++ is used. The outcome is a formally proven correct system implementation. The efficiency of the proposed method is exhibited through the design of a case study from the telecommunication domain.},

  ABSTRACT = {Formal notations like B or action systems support a notion of refinement. Refinement relates an abstract specification AA to a more deterministic concrete specification CC. Knowing AA and CC one proves CC refines, or implements, specification AA. In this study we consider specification AA as given and concern ourselves with a way to find a good candidate for implementation CC. To this end we classify all implementations of an abstract specification according to their performance. We distinguish performance from correctness. Concrete systems that do not meet the abstract specification correctly are excluded. Only the remaining correct implementations CC are considered with respect to their performance. A good implementation of a specification is identified by having some optimal behaviour in common with it. In other words, a good refinement corresponds to a reduction of non-optimal behaviour. This also means that the abstract specification sets a boundary for the performance of any implementation. We introduce the probabilistic action system formalism which combines refinement with performance. In our current study we measure performance in terms of long-run expected average-cost. Performance is expressed by means of probability and expected costs. Probability is needed to express uncertainty present in physical environments. Expected costs express physical or abstract quantities that describe a system. They encode the performance objective. The behaviour of probabilistic action systems is described by traces of expected costs. A corresponding notion of refinement and simulation-based proof rules are introduced. Probabilistic action systems are based on discrete-time Markov decision processes. Numerical methods solving the optimisation problems posed by Markov decision processes are well-known, and used in a software tool that we have developed. The tool computes an optimal behaviour of a specification AA thus assisting in the search for a good implementation CC.},

  ABSTRACT = {The approach presented in this book relies on the unification of system specification environments for developing electronic systems that are formally proven to be correct (correct-by-construction systems). The key concept conveyed is the formal proof of system properties, which is carried out at every phase of the co-design cycle. The main idea is to build fully functional system models that are formally proven to be correct, and based on them to produce automatically the hardware and the software parts of the system. The approach presented relies on the combined use of UML and B language.},

  ABSTRACT = {In this chapter we discuss modeling of hardware and translation to VHDL. Translation to SystemC or Verilog is similar. However VHDL is easier to read and we use VHDL synthesis tools. Translation is important to provide a complete path from formal models to a circuit. Equally important we need a refinement method to arrive at a formal circuit description that can be translated. This method has some significant differences to the refinement method for software. As one would expect, they are virtually not present at system level but become more and more visible as an actual implementation is approached. This means that the initial refinement steps used in hardware are, in principle, also applicable to software, and vice versa. The subset of the B-language that serves to describe hardware is called BHDL. The definition of the BHDL subset is oriented at the register transfer level for hardware description.},

  ABSTRACT = {This chapter presents a study of the SAE J1708 Serial Communication link. The study is carried out in Event-B, an extension of the B method. The system is implemented and decomposed using step-wise refinement. We present how to derive with this method a cycle-accurate hardware model. The model of the communication link system is composed of an arbitrary finite number of identical components that run concurrently. The model contains synchronisation of these components required to control access to the communication link. At the end of the refinement we obtain an implementable model of the components which is translated into VHDL. The generated VHDL design is synthesizable, meaning that the implementable B model is synthesizable as well.},

  ABSTRACT = {Formal refinement as offered by the B method has been shown to be applicable in practice and to scale up. However, it has been recognised that it is difficult communicate a formal B model with customers. Recently, the UML has been investigated as an interface to rigorous formal B models to facilitate this communication. The UML is generally accepted as being a good vehicle for communicating models of systems. Availability of this interface to the B method addresses a major problem faced by most formal methods: How to validate a formal model with a customer who is not formal methods expert? In this chapter we present an approach to the development of a formally verified circuit implementing a Hamming encoder/decoder. The UML-B is used as a formal specification language and the B method is used to prove refinements until the implementation level at which we can translate into VHDL.},

  ABSTRACT = {ProB is an animator and model checker for the B method. It also allows to visualise the state space of a B machine in graphical way. This is often very useful and allows users to quickly spot whether the machine behaves as expected. However, for larger state spaces the visualisation quickly becomes difficult to grasp by users (and the computation of the graph layout takes considerable time). In this paper we present two relatively simple algorithms to often considerably reduce the complexity of the graphs, while still keeping relevant information. This makes it possible to visualise much larger state spaces and gives the user immediate feedback about the overall behaviour of a machine. The algorithms have been implemented within the ProB toolset and we highlight their potential on several examples. We also conduct a thorough experimentation of the algorithm on 47 B machines and analyse the results.},

  ABSTRACT = {Program slicing is a well-known methodology that aims at identifying the program statements that (potentially) affect the values computed at some point of interest. Within imperative programming, this technique has been successfully applied to debugging, specialization, merging, reuse, maintenance, etc. Due to its declarative nature, adapting the slicing notions and techniques to a logic programming setting is not an easy task. In this work, we define the first, semantics-preserving, forward slicing technique for logic programs. Our approach relies on the application of a conjunctive partial deduction algorithm for a precise propagation of information between calls. <br/> We do not distinguish between static and dynamic slicing since partial deduction can naturally deal with both static and dynamic data. Furthermore, this approach can quite easily be implemented by adding a new code generator on top of existing partial deduction systems. A slicing tool has been implemented in ECCE, where a post-processing transformation to remove redundant arguments has been added. Experiments conducted on a wide variety of programs are encouraging and demonstrate the usefulness of our approach, both as a classical slicing method and as a technique for code size reduction.},

  ABSTRACT = {We present ProTest, an automatic test environment for B specifications. B is a model-oriented notation where systems are specified in terms of abstract states and operations on abstract states. ProTest first generates a state coverage graph of a B specification through exhaustive model checking, and the coverage graph is traversed to generate a set of test cases, each being a sequence of B operations. For the model checking to be exhaustive, some transformations are applied to the sets used in the B machine. The approach also works if it is not exhaustive; one can stop at any point in time during the state space exploration and generate test cases from the coverage graph obtained so far. ProTest then simultaneously performs animation of the B machine and the execution of the corresponding implementation in Java, and assign verdicts on the test results. With some restrictions imposed on the B operations, the whole of the testing process is performed mechanically. We demonstrate the efficacy of our test environment by performing a small case study from industry. Furthermore, we present a solution to the problem of handling non-determinism in B operations.},

The algorithm is based on mutating the annotations of offline partial evaluation.<br/> Using a set of representative sample queries it decides upon the fitness of annotations, controlling the trade-off between code explosion, speedup gained and specialisation time. The user can specify the importance of each of these factors in determining the quality of the produced code, tailoring the specialisation to the particular problem at hand. <br/> We present experimental results for our implemented technique on a series of benchmarks. The results are compared against the aggressive termination based binding-time analysis and optimised using different measures for the quality of code.

  ABSTRACT = {This text describes a proof obligation generator for EventB. Most of the document describes the actual generated proof obligations and justification of their correctness. The algorithm for their generation is very simple. We distinguish generated proof obligations from theoretical ones. Theoretical proof obligations are well-suited for hand-written mathematical proofs but less suited for machine-assisted proof. In particular, generated proof obligations have be obtained by decomposing theoretical proof obligations as far as possible so that they are as simple as possible; and hopefully provable by an automatic prover. Substitutions produced by the proof obligation generator are left unevaluated. These are applied in a preprocessing step of the proof manager. The reason for this is to keep the design of the proof obligation generator distinct from the actual provers. By using witnesses in models a part of the proof has been moved into modelling itself. The price to pay is that one has to think about proving while modelling. The advantage is that proofs are decomposed and almost all existential quantifiers are removed from the consequents of proof obligations. There are three main sections on contexts, initial models, and refined models. Each of these contains three subsections: the description subsection introduces the notation used in the section; the theory subsection presents the theoretical proof obligations and derives the generated proof obligations by proof; the generated proof obligations subsection contains the list of proof obligations to be generated by the proof obligation generator. This last section also contains proof obligations for well-definedness. On first reading well-definedness proof obligations should be ignored. These are necessary but are actually not derived from the theoretical proof obligations.},

But formal modelling of complex systems is a difficult task. Even when theorem provers improve further and get more powerful, modelling will remain difficult. The reason for this that modelling is an exploratory activity that requires ingenuity in order to arrive at a meaningful model. We are aware that automated theorem provers can discharge most of the onerous trivial proof obligations that appear when modelling systems. In this article we present a modelling tool that seamlessly integrates modelling and proving similar to what is offered today in modern integrated development environments for programming. The tool is extensible and configurable so that it can be adapted more easily to different application domains and development methods.},

We describe how symmetry markers can be efficiently computed and integrated into the Spin tool, and provide an empirical evaluation of our technique using the Topspin symmetry reduction package, which shows very good performance results and a high degree of precision for the approximate method (i.e. very few non-symmetric states receive the same marker).

Today, the algorithms for shadow and check computation are specific for every pointcut designator. This makes it very tedious to extend the pointcut language. We propose the use of declarative languages, together with associated analysis and specialisation tools, to implement powerful and extensible pointcut languages. More specifically, we propose to synthesize (rather than program manually) the shadow and dynamic check algorithms. With this approach, it becomes easier to implement powerful pointcut languages efficiently and to keep pointcut languages open for extension.},

  ABSTRACT = {Writing a formal specification for real-life, industrial problems is a difficult and error prone task, even for experts in formal methods. In the process of specifying a formal model for later refinement and implementation it is crucial to get approval and feedback from domain experts to avoid the costs of changing a specification at a late point of the development. But understanding formal models written in a specification language like B requires mathematical knowledge a domain expert might not have. In this paper we present a new tool to visualize B Machines using the ProB animator and Macromedia Flash. Our tool offers an easy way for specifiers to build a domain specific visualization that can be used by domain experts to check whether a B specification corresponds to their expectations.},

  ABSTRACT = {Symmetry reduction is an established method for limiting the amount of states that have to be checked during exhaustive model checking. The idea is to only verify a single representative of every class of symmetric states. However, computing this representative can be nontrivial, especially for a language such as B with its involved data structures and operations. In this paper, we propose an alternate approach, called permutation flooding. It works by computing permutations of newly encountered states, and adding them to the state space. This turns out to be relatively unproblematic for B?s data structures and we have implemented the algorithm inside the ProB model checker. Empirical results confirm that this approach is effective in practice; speedups exceed an order of magnitude in some cases. The paper also contains correctness results of permutation flooding, which should also be applicable for classical symmetry reduction in B.},

  ABSTRACT = {Symmetry reduction is a technique that can help alleviate the problem of state space explosion in model checking. The idea is to verify only a subset of states from each class (orbit) of symmetric states. This paper presents a framework for symmetry reduced model checking of B machines, which verifies a unique representative from each orbit. Symmetries are induced by the deferred set; a key component of the B language. This contrasts with strategies that require the introduction of a special data type into a language, to indicate symmetry. An extended version of the graph isomorphism program, textitnauty, is used to detect symmetries, and the symmetry reduction package has been integrated into the ProB model checker. Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the method, where exponential speedups are sometimes possible. Relevant algorithms are presented, and there is a comparison with an alternate symmetry reduction strategy, called permutation flooding.},

  ABSTRACT = {We present the architecture and implementation of the ProZ tool to validate high-level Z specifications. The tool was integrated into ProB, by providing a translation of Z into B and by extending the kernel of ProB to accommodate some new syntax and data types. We describe the challenge of going from the tool friendly formalism B to the more specification-oriented formalism Z, and show how many Z specifications can be systematically translated into B. We describe the extensions, such as record types and free types, that had to be added to the kernel to support a large subset of Z. As a side-effect, we provide a way to animate and model check records in ProB. By incorporating ProZ into ProB, we have inherited many of the recent extensions developed for B, such as the integration with CSP or the animation of recursive functions. Finally, we present a successful industrial application, which makes use of this fact, and where ProZ was able to discover several errors in Z specifications containing higher-order recursive functions.},

  ABSTRACT = {The B-method, as well as its offspring Event-B, are both tool-supported formal methods used for the development of computer systems whose correctness is formally proven. However, the more complex the specification becomes, the more proof obligations need to be discharged. While many proof obligations can be discharged automatically by recent tools such as the Rodin platform, a considerable number still have to be proven interactively. This can be either because the required proof is too complicated or because the B model is erroneous. In this paper we describe a disprover plugin for Rodin that utilizes the ProB animator and model checker to automatically find counterexamples for a given problematic proof obligation. In case the disprover finds a counterexample, the user can directly investigate the source of the problem (as pinpointed by the counterexample) and should not attempt to prove the proof obligation. We also discuss under which circumstances our plug-in can be used as a prover, i.e., when the absence of a counterexample actually is a proof of the proof obligation.},

  ABSTRACT = {Typical modern dynamic languages have a growing number of implementations. We explore the reasons for this situation, and the limitations it imposes on open source or academic communities that lack the resources to fine-tune and maintain them all. It is sometimes proposed that implementing dynamic languages on top of a standardized general-purpose ob ject-oriented virtual machine (like Java or .NET) would help reduce this burden. We propose a complementary alternative to writing custom virtual machine (VMs) by hand, validated by the PyPy pro ject: flexibly generating VMs from a high-level ?specification?, inserting features and low-level details automatically ? including good just-in-time compilers tuned to the dynamic language at hand. We believe this to be ultimately a better investment of efforts than the development of more and more advanced general-purpose object oriented VMs. In this paper we compare these two approaches in detail.},

It extends the expressiveness of Event-B allowing us to prove properties of systems that could not be formalised in Event-B before. We demonstrate this by means of a small example, part of a larger Event-B development that could not be fully proved before. An important feature of the introduced construction is that it does not complicate the existing Event-B notation or method, and can be explained without referring to the underlying more complicated probabilistic theory. The necessary theory itself is briefly outlined in this article to justify the soundness of the proof obligations given. We also give a short account of alternative constructions that we explored, and rejected.},

Event-B is a notation and method developed from the B-Method and is intended to be used with an incremental style of modelling. The idea of incremental modelling has been taken from programming: modern programming languages come with integrated development environments that make it easy to modify and improve programs. The Rodin tool provides such an environment for Event-B. The two main characteristics of the Rodin tool are its ease of use and its extensibility. The tool focuses on modelling. It is easy to modify models and try out variations of a model. The tool can also be extended easily. This will make it possible to adapt the tool specific needs. So the tool can be adapted to fit into existing development processes instead demanding the opposite. We believe that these two characteristics are major points for industrial uptake.},

  ABSTRACT = {Symmetry reduction holds great promise to counter the state explosion problem. However, currently it is ``conducting a life on the fringe'', and is not widely applied, mainly due to the restricted applicability of many of the techniques. In this paper we propose a symmetry reduction technique applied to high-level formal specification languages (B and Z). Not only does symmetry arise naturally in most models, it can also be exploited without restriction by our method. This method translates states of a formal model into directed graphs, and then uses graph canonicalisation to detect symmetries. We use the tool nauty to efficiently perform graph canonicalisation, which we have interfaced with the model checker ProB. In this paper we present the general technique, show how states can be translated first into vertex-coloured graphs suitable for nauty. We present empirical results, showing the effectiveness of our method as well as analysing the cost of graph canonicalisation.},

We investigate the reasons for this behaviour, examining expressivity, granularity and Spin's search algorithms. We also show that certain types of information (such as symmetry) can be more easily inferred and exploited in high-level models, leading to a considerable reduction in model checking time.},

  ABSTRACT = {We report on our experiences with the Spy project, including implementation details and benchmark results. Spy is a re-implementation of the Squeak (i.e. Smalltalk-80) VM using the PyPy toolchain. The PyPy project allows code written in RPython, a subset of Python, to be translated to a multitude of different backends and architectures. During the translation, many aspects of the implementation can be independently tuned, such as the garbage collection algorithm or threading implementation. In this way, a whole host of interpreters can be derived from one abstract interpreter definition. Spy aims to bring these benefits to Squeak, allowing for greater portability and, eventually, improved performance. The current Spy codebase is able to run a small set of benchmarks that demonstrate performance superior to many similar Smalltalk VMs, but which still run slower than in Squeak itself. Spy was built from scratch over the course of a week during a joint Squeak-PyPy Sprint in Bern last autumn.},

  ABSTRACT = {A reasonable approach to formal modelling is to start with a specification that captures the requirements of a system and then use formal refinement to implement it. The problem with this approach is that for complex systems the specification itself is complex. It becomes a challenge to say whether the specification is the right one for the given requirements. Sometimes requirements also concern features of a system closely related to its implementation. This would make an abstract specification necessarily incomplete. We believe that it is better not to follow the rigid approach to modelling described above. Instead, we argue that the specification itself should be elaborated by refinement. Ultimately, the distinction between specification and implementation is no longer made in the strict sense above. There is only one model of the system that is connected by successive refinements. Using Event-B, we demonstrate how this can be applied to cope with the complexity of specifications. On the one hand we benefit from the reduced number of detail to consider at different times. On the other hand we are encouraged to reason about the formal model since the beginning and to rethink it occasionally to capture better its intended behaviour and match the requirements.},

  ABSTRACT = {Event-B is a formal modelling method which is claimed to be suitable for diverse modelling domains, such as reactive systems and sequential program development. This claim hinges on the fact that any particular model has an appropriate semantics. In Event-B this semantics is provided implicitly by proof obligations associated with a model. There is no fixed semantics though. In this article we argue that this approach is beneficial to modelling because we can use similar proof obligations across a variety of modelling domains. By way of two examples we show how similar proof obligations are linked to different semantics. A small set of proof obligations is thus suitable for a whole range of modelling problems in diverse modelling domains.},

  ABSTRACT = {We describe the use of a flexible meta-interpreter for performing access control checks on deductive databases. The meta-program is implemented in Prolog and takes as input a database and an access policy specification. For processing access control requests we specialise the meta-program for a given access policy and database by using the Logen partial evaluation system. The resulting specialised control checking program is dependent solely upon dynamic information that can only be known at the time of actual access request evaluation. In addition to describing our approach, we give a number of performance measures for our implementation of an access control checker. In particular, we show that by using our approach we get flexible access control with virtually no overhead, satisfying the Jones optimality criterion. The paper also shows how to satisfy the Jones optimality criterion more generally for interpreters written in the non-ground representation.},

  ABSTRACT = {ProB is an animation and model checking tool for the B Method, which can deal with many interesting specifications. Some specifications, however, contain complicated functions which cannot be represented explicitly by a tool. We present a scheme with which higher-order recursive functions can be encoded in B, and establish soundness of this scheme. We then describe a symbolic representation for such functions. This representation enables ProB to successfully animate and model check a new class of relevant specifications, where animation is especially important due to the involved nature of the specification.},

  ABSTRACT = {We introduce a just-in-time specializer for Prolog. Just-in-time specialization attempts to unify of the concepts and benefits of partial evaluation (PE) and just-in-time (JIT) compilation. It is a variant of PE that occurs purely at runtime, which lazily generates residual code and is constantly driven by runtime feedback. Our prototype is an on-line just-in-time partial evaluator. A major focus of our work is to remove the overhead incurred when executing an interpreter written in Prolog. It improves over classical offline PE by requiring almost no heuristics nor hints from the author of the interpreter; it also avoids most termination issues due to interleaving execution and specialization. We evaluate the performance of our prototype on a small number of benchmarks.},

  ABSTRACT = {We attempt to apply the technique of Tracing JIT Compilers in the context of the PyPy project, i.e. to programs that are interpreters for some dynamic languages, including Python. Tracing JIT compilers can greatly speed up programs that spend most of their time in loops in which they take similar code paths. However, applying an unmodified tracing JIT to a program that is itself a bytecode interpreter results in very limited or no speedup. In this paper we show how to guide tracing JIT compilers to greatly improve the speed of bytecode interpreters. One crucial point is to unroll the bytecode dispatch loop, based on two hints provided by the implementer of the bytecode interpreter. We evaluate our technique by applying it to two PyPy interpreters: one is a small example, and the other one is the full Python interpreter.},

  ABSTRACT = {In this paper we describe the successful application of the ProB validation tool on an industrial case study. The case study centres on the San Juan metro system installed by Siemens. The control software was developed and formally proven with B. However, the development contains certain assumptions about the actual rail network topology which have to be validated separately in order to ensure safe operation. For this task, Siemens has developed custom proof rules for AtelierB. AtelierB, however, was unable to deal with about 80 properties of the deployment (running out of memory). These properties thus had to be validated by hand at great expense (and they need to be revalidated whenever the rail network infrastructure changes).<br/> In this paper we show how we were able to use ProB to validate all of the about 300 properties of the San Juan deployment, detecting exactly the same faults automatically in around 17 minutes that were manually uncovered in about one man-month. This achievement required the extension of the ProB kernel for large sets as well as an improved constraint propagation phase. We also outline some of the effort and features that were required in moving from a tool capable of dealing with medium-sized examples towards a tool able to deal with actual industrial specifications. Notably, a new parser and type checker had to be developed. We also touch upon the issue of validating ProB, so that it can be integrated into the SIL4 development chain at Siemens},

This is of considerable benefit to the modeler, as it allows him to switch between the various tools to validate, debug and improve his or her models. The crucial idea of this paper is that the integrated platform also provides benefits to the tool developer, i.e., it allows easy access to information from other tools. Indeed, there has been considerable interest in combining model checking, proving and testing. In previous work we have already shown how a model checker can be used to complement the Event-B proving environment, by acting as a disprover. In this paper we show how the prover can help improve the efficiency of the animator and model checker.},

  ABSTRACT = {Usually we teach formal methods relying for a large part on one kind of reasoning technique about a formal model. For instance, we either use formal proof or we use model-checking. It would appear that it is already hard enough to learn one technique and having to cope with two puts just another burden on the students. This is not our experience. Especially model-checking is easily used to complement formal proof. It only relies on an intuitive operational understanding of a formal model. In this article we show how using model-checking, animation, and formal proof together can be used to improve understanding of formal models. We demonstrate how animation can help finding an explanation for a failing proof. We also demonstrate where animation or model-checking may not help and where proving may not help. For most part use of another tool pays off. Proof obligations present intentionally a static view of a system so that we focus on abstract properties of a model and not on its behaviour. By contrast model-checking provides a more dynamic view based on an operational interpretation. Both views are valuable aids to reasoning about a model.},

  ABSTRACT = {When teaching Event-B to beginners, we usually start with models that are already good enough, demonstrating occasionally some standard techniques like ``invariant strengthening''. We show that we got it essentially right but need to make improvements here and there. However, this is not how we really create formal models. To a beginner, getting shown only nearly perfect models is overwhelming. So we should start earlier and show how we usually get models wrong initially. This provides ample opportunity to demonstrate the strengths of formal reasoning (and the weaknesses). The principal strength of formal reasoning lies in its capacity to locate mistakes in a model and to suggest corrections. A beginner should learn how to profit from his mistakes by improving his understanding of the model. A weakness of formal reasoning is that we only find mistakes that we expect, for example, invariant violation or non-termination. Mistakes that do not fall into one of these categories may slip through. In this article we present how a formal model is created by refinement and alteration. The approach employs mathematical methodology for problem solving and a software tool. Both aspects are important. Mathematical methodology provides ways to turn mistakes into improvements. The software tool is necessary to ease the impact of changes on a model and to obtain rapid feed back. We begin with a set of assumptions and requirements, the problem, and set out to solve it, giving a more vivid picture of how formal methods work.},

  ABSTRACT = {The Event-B method can be used to model all sorts of discrete event systems, among them sequential programs. We have made the experience that the minimalist nature of Event-B is of advantage when it comes to tool support and to using proof as a means to analyse a model. The downside of the minimalism is that when models get more complex the lack of structure in the models can make them cluttered with auxiliary variables. System decomposition will not solve this problem. This can not be reasonably applied to a sequential program. In this article we describe our experiences with using Event-B by way of an example. We show how we verified iterative Quicksort in Event-B and intersperse our observations and criticisms. We use them to formulate some suggestions of how we believe Event-B should evolve in future. Some of the minimalism may have to be abandoned in favour of more clarity of the produced formal models.},

Furthermore, quite surprisingly, it turned out that the use of a high-level model checker such as prob, was much more effective in practice than using a very efficient model checker such as spin on the corresponding low-level model. In this paper, we try to put this anecdotal evidence on a more firm empirical footing, by systematically comparing the development and validation of B models with the development and validation corresponding Promela models. These experiments have confirmed our previous experience, and show the merits of using a high-level specification language such as B, both in a teaching and in a research environment.},

  ABSTRACT = {Event-B does not provide specific support for the modelling of problems that require some structuring, such as, local variables or sequential ordering of events. All variables need to be declared globally and sequential ordering of events can only be achieved by abstract program counters. This has two unfortunate consequences: such models become less comprehensible - we have to infer sequential ordering from the use of program counters; proof obligation generation does not consider ordering - generating too many proof obligations (although these are usually trivially discharged). In this article we propose a method for specifying structured models avoiding, in particular, the use of abstract program counters. It uses a notation that mainly serves to drive proof obligation generation. However, the notation also describes the structure of a model explicitly. A corresponding graphical notation is introduced that visualises the structure of a model.},

  ABSTRACT = {The size of formal models is steadily increasing and there is a demand from industrial users to be able to use expressive temporal query languages for validating and exploring high-level formal specifications. We present an extension of LTL, which is well adapted for validating B, Z and CSP specifications. We present a generic, flexible LTL model checker, implemented inside the ProB tool, that can be applied to a multitude of formalisms such as B, Z, CSP, B CSP, as well as Object Petri nets, compensating CSP, and dSL. Our algorithm can deal with deadlock states, partially explored state spaces, past operators, and can be combined with existing symmetry reduction techniques of ProB. We establish correctness of our algorithm in general, as well as combined with symmetry reduction. Finally, we present various applications and empirical results of our tool, showing that it can be applied successfully in practice.},

  ABSTRACT = {We present a new approximate verification technique for falsifying the invariants of B models. The technique employs symmetry of B models induced by the use of deferred sets. The basic idea is to efficiently compute markers for states, so that symmetric states are guaranteed to have the same marker (but not the other way around).<br/> The falsification algorithm then assumes that two states with the same marker can be considered symmetric. We describe how symmetry markers can be efficiently computed and empirically evaluate an implementation, showing both very good performance results and a high degree of precision (i.e., very few non-symmetric states receive the same marker).<br/> We also identify a class of B models for which the technique is precise and therefore provides an efficient and complete verification method. Finally, we show that the technique can be applied to Z models as well.},

  ABSTRACT = {Most Prolog implementations are implemented in low-level languages such as C and are based on a variation of the WAM instruction set, which enhances their performance but makes them hard to write. We present a high-level continuation-based Prolog interpreter written in RPython, a restricted subset of Python. This interpreter is annotated with hints, so that it can be fed through the PyPy tracing JIT generator, which incorporates partial evaluation techniques. The resulting Prolog implementation is surprisingly efficient: it clearly outperforms existing implementations of Prolog in high-level languages such as Java. Moreover, on some benchmarks, our system outperforms state-of-the-art WAM-based Prolog implementations. Our paper tries to show that PyPy can indeed form the basis for implementing programming languages other than Python. Furthermore, we believe that our results showcase the great potential of the tracing JIT approach for declarative programming languages},

  ABSTRACT = {ProB is a model checker for high-level formalisms such as B, Event-B, CSP and Z. ProB uses a mixed depth-first/breadth-first search strategy, and in previous work we have argued that this can perform better in practice than pure depth-first or breadth-first search, as employed by low-level model checkers. In this paper we present a thorough empirical evaluation of this technique, which confirms our conjecture. The experiments were conducted on a wide variety of B and Event-B models, including several industrial case studies. Furthermore, we have extended ProB to be able to perform directed model checking, where each state is associated with a priority computed by a heuristic function. We evaluate various heuristic functions, on a series of problems, and find some interesting candidates for detecting deadlocks and finding specific target states.},

Rather than building a project-specific solution, we decided to develop an extensible, general purpose platform.<br> We based the tool's data model on the Requirements Interchange Format (RIF / ReqIF), a standard driven by the automotive industry. This gives us interoperability with a number of existing tools. The tool is based on the Eclipse Platform and uses the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF). We managed to establish a cooperation with the ITEA-Project ``Verde'', which supplied the implementation of the RIF data model.<br> In this paper, we will introduce the tool, describe its architecture, and present a small case study.

  ABSTRACT = {In this paper we describe the successful application of the ProB validation tool for several industrial applications. The initial case study centred on the San Juan metro system installed by Siemens. The control software was developed and formally proven with B. However, the development contains certain assumptions about the actual rail network topology which have to be validated separately in order to ensure safe operation. For this task, Siemens has developed custom proof rules for Atelier B. Atelier B, however, was unable to deal with about 80 properties of the deployment (running out of memory). These properties thus had to be validated by hand at great expense (and they need to be revalidated whenever the rail network infrastructure changes).<br/> In this paper we show how we were able to use ProB to validate all of the about 300 properties of the San Juan deployment, detecting exactly the same faults automatically in a few minutes that were manually uncovered in about one man-month. We have repeated this task for three ongoing projects at Siemens, notably the ongoing automatisation of the line 1 of the Paris Metro. Here again, about a man month of effort has been replaced by a few minutes of computation.<br/> This achievement required the extension of the ProB kernel for large sets as well as an improved constraint propagation phase. We also outline some of the effort and features that were required in moving from a tool capable of dealing with medium-sized examples towards a tool able to deal with actual industrial specifications. We also describe the issue of validating ProB, so that it can be integrated into the SIL4 development chain at Siemens.},

  ABSTRACT = {Requirements engineering (RE) is a crucial aspect in systems development and is the area of ongoing research and process improvement. However, unlike in modelling, there has been no established standard that activities could converge on.<br> In recent years, the emerging Requirements Interchange Format (RIF/ReqIF) gained more and more visibility in industry, and research projects start to investigate these standards. To avoid redundant efforts in implementing the standard, the VERDE and Deploy projects cooperate to provide a stable common basis for RIF/ReqIF that could be leveraged by other research projects too. In this paper, we present an Eclipse-based extensible implementation of a RIF/ReqIF-based requirements editing platform.<br> In addition, we are concerned with two related aspects of RE that take advantage of the common platform. First, how can the quality of requirements be improved by replacing or complementing natural language requirements with formal approaches such as domain specific languages or models. Second, how can we establish robust traceability that links requirements and model constructs and other artefacts of the development process. We present two approaches to traceability and two approaches to modelling.<br> We believe that our research represents a significant contribution to the existing tooling landscape, as it is the first clean-room implementation of the RIF/ReqIF standard. We believe that it will help reduce gaps in often heterogeneous tool chains and inspire new conceptual work and new tools.},

  ABSTRACT = {In Event-B a system is developed using refinement. The language is based on a relatively small core; in particular there is only a very small number of substitutions. This results in much simpler proof obligations, that can be handled by automatic tools. However, the downside is that, in case of software development, structural information is not explicitly available but hidden in the chain of refinements. This paper discusses a method to uncover these implicit algorithmic structures and use them in a model checker. Other applications are code generation, model comprehension, and testcase generation.},

The complexity of typical computing systems can be addressed by formal refinement introducing all the necessary details piecemeal. We report on preliminary results that we have obtained for tracing informal natural-language requirements into formal models across refinement levels. The approach uses the WRSPM reference model for requirements modeling, and Event-B for formal modeling and formal refinement. The combined use of WRSPM and Event-B is facilitated by the rudimentary refinement notion of WRSPM, which provides the foundation for tracing requirements to formal refinements.<br> We assume that requirements are evolving, meaning that we have to cope with frequent changes of the requirements model and the formal model. Our approach is capable of dealing with frequent changes, making use of corresponding techniques already built into the Event-B method.},

The case study discussed in this article -- a cruise control system -- is a serious test of industrial use. We report on where Event-B and its tools have succeeded, where they have not. We also report on advances that were inspired by the case study. Interestingly, the case study was not a pure formal methods problem. In addition to Event-B, it used Problem Frames for capturing requirements. The interaction between the two proved to be crucial for the success of the case study. The heart of the problem was tracing informal requirements from Problem Frames descriptions to formal Event-B models. To a large degree, this issue dictated the approach that had to be used for formal modelling. A dedicated record theory and dedicated tool support were required. The size of the formal models rather than complex individual formulas was the main challenge for tool support.},

However, there are still considerable differences, such as very different approaches to typing and modularization. There is also considerable difference in the available tool support. In this paper, we present a translation of the non-temporal part of TLA+ to B, which makes it possible to feed TLA+ specifications into existing tools for B. Part of this translation must include a type inference algorithm, in order to produce typed B specifications. There are many other tricky aspects, such as translating modules as well as let and if-then-else expressions. We also present an integration of our translation into ProB. ProB thus provides a complementary tool to the explicit state model checker TLC, with convenient animation and constraint solving for TLA+. We also present a series of case studies, highlighting the complementarity to TLC. In particular, we highlight the sometimes dramatic difference in performance when it comes to solving complicated constraints in TLA+.},

  ABSTRACT = {<p>Traceability within a system description is a challenging problem of requirements engineering. In particular, formal models of the system are often based on informal requirements, but creating and maintaining the traceability between the two can be challenging. Previously, we presented an incremental approach for producing a system description from an initial set of requirements. The foundation of the approach is a classification of requirements into artefacts W (domain properties), R (requirements) and S (specification). In addition, the approach uses designated phenomena as the vocabulary employed by the artefacts. The central idea is that adequacy of the system description must be justified, meaning that W /\ S => R. The approach establishes a traceability, and the resulting system description may consist of formal and informal artefacts.</p><p>We created tool support for this approach by integrating Rodin and ProR ...</p>},

  ABSTRACT = {<p>Rodin is a platform for Event-B modelling. Its native editor is a structural editor that allows the modification of a tree-like model.</p> <p>Especially for large models, some users found the default editor inadequate and preferred a text-based editor. Such an editor, called Camille, was created by Fabian Fritz in 2009 and was a huge success.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Camille does not directly support extensions for Rodin. As more and more extensions are being created, this became a larger issue over the years.</p> <p>This report analyses how Camille extensibility can be achieved. It analyses a number of different architectures and compares their mutual advantages and disadvantages.</p> <p>This paper discusses four different approaches. Out of these, we find two particularly promising. The first option would be the implementation of a block parser that provides a useful default implementation for plug-in developers and a pleasing syntax to editor users. The second option is the use of an existing syntax like YAML. This solution could be extended all the way to the persistence layer of Rodin, thereby simplifying the back end significantly. But such an effort would require additional resources. Nevertheless, the result would simplify maintenance of the platform significantly in the long run.</p>},

These operations occur frequently in generated traces and therefore it is important to design and implement them carefully to find the right trade-off between deoptimization, memory overhead, and (partly) execution speed. In this paper, we perform an empirical analysis of runtime properties of guards. This is used to guide the design of guards in the RPython tracing JIT.},

  ABSTRACT = {<p>Creating a system description of high quality is still a challenging problem in the field of requirements engineering. Creating a formal system description addresses some issues. However, the relationship of the formal model to the user requirements is rarely clear, or documented satisfactorily.</p> <p>This work presents the ProR approach, an approach for the creation of a consistent system description from an initial set of requirements. The resulting system description is a mixture of formal and informal artefacts. Formal and informal reasoning is employed to aid in the process. To achieve this, the artefacts must be connected by traces to support formal and informal reasoning, so that conclusions about the system description can be drawn.</p> <p>The ProR approach enables the incremental creation of the system description, alternating between modelling (both formal and informal) and validation. During this process, the necessary traceability for reasoning about the system description is established. The formal model employs refinement for further structuring of large and complex system descriptions. The development of the ProR approach is the first contribution of this work.</p> <p>This work also presents ProR, a tool platform for requirements engineering, that supports the ProR approach. ProR has been integrated with Rodin, a tool for Event-B modelling, to provide a number of features that allow the ProR approach to scale.</p> <p>The core features of ProR are independent from the ProR approach. The data model of ProR builds on the international ReqIF standard, which provides interoperability with industrial tools for requirements engineering. The development of ProR created enough interest to justify the creation of the Requirements Modeling Framework (RMF), a new Eclipse Foundation project, which is the open source host for ProR. RMF attracted an active community, and ProR development continues. The development of ProR is the second contribution of this work.</p> <p>This work is accompanied by a case study of a traffic light system, which demonstrates the application of both the ProR approach and ProR.</p>},

It further includes the risk of maintenance and long-term support. </p><p> We see industrial interest in open source for systems engineering in general, and Eclipse in particular. Eclipse is attractive, because its license is business-friendly. Further, its modular architecture makes it easy to seamlessly integrate the various Eclipse-based tools for systems engineering. </p><p> This paper focuses on an ecosystem that is accumulated around two Eclipse-based platforms, First, the Rodin platform is an open source modeling environment for the Event-B formalism.

  ABSTRACT = {Model checking of a specification using ProB can easily become a task with a long running time. However, the task can very easily be parallelized. If we had a transition system (the state space) and an invariant we could partition the vertices of the state space into k partitions of equal size and then check the invariant on k processors in parallel. However, in reality we cannot afford to precompute the state space in advance. We need to explore the state space itself in parallel. This imposes some challenges that the implementation has to address. Firstly, we have to avoid duplicated invariant checking or at least make sure that duplicate invariant checking does not happen too often in practice. Also in contrast to an offline algorithm, the online version cannot split up the workload fairly. This reduces the scalability of the approach. In particular, the scalability depends on the model. For example, let us consider a counter specification that has an integer variable x ranging from zero to a billion. The variable is initialized with the value zero, and the model has a single event that increments x by one. Assuming that we have k processors, the offline version can easily partition the state space and ensure that every processor gets the same amount of work. For instance, it can decide to use x mod k to determine the processor for a state. The online algorithm has only a limited sight. It processes only one state at a time because each state has a single successor state.},

  ABSTRACT = {In a previous work, we applied constraint solving techniques to problems like invariant preservation and deadlock freedom checking [2]. The idea behind constraint based deadlock checking is that we set up a logical formula encoding a state where the invariant holds, but all guards are false. We then use the built-in constraint solver to check if the formula has a model. If we can find such a model, we know that the system cannot be proven to be deadlock free. The invariant preservation checking is similar. We encode a state where the invariant holds and a successor state (for some event) where the invariant is false. If this formula has a model, we know that the system cannot be proven correctly. Note that in both cases we do not require that the states are reachable. The system might behave correctly, but the invariant is too weak to prove its correctness.},

  ABSTRACT = {Most state-based formal methods, like B, Event-B or Z, provide support for static typing. However, these methods and the associated tools lack support for annotating variables with (physical) units of measurement. There is thus no obvious way to reason about correct or incorrect usage of such units. In this paper we present a technique that analyses the usage of physical units throughout a B machine, infers missing units and notifies the user of incorrectly handled units. The technique combines abstract interpretation with classical animation and model checking and has been integrated into the ProB validation tool, both for classical B and for Event-B. It provides source-level feedback about errors detected in the models. The plugin uses a combination of abstract interpretation and constraint solving techniques. We provide an empirical evaluation of our technique, and demonstrate that it scales up to real-life industrial models.},

  ABSTRACT = {Based on methods for program verification by refinement such as the B-Method or VDM we propose an approach for verifying programs composed of sequential and concurrent parts. Similar to the approach to modelling and proving taken in Event-B we focus on the support for incremental development and ease of proof. We achieve this by following the style of proof obligations used in Event-B. Mixing sequentiality and concurrency requires some structuring in the modelling notation. The main challenge of our approach is permitting such structuring while keeping proof as easy as possible. To achieve this we pragmatic with respect to the proof techniques employed borrowing from Hoare-style program verification and rely-guarantee reasoning. The approach is suitable for reasoning about abstract models of programs where refinement is used for structuring a complex proof. It does not describe a development method by step-wise refinement but an approach to fill in gaps in a complex proof. Refinement is used to produce proofs comparable to those obtained by Hoare-style verification but with flexibility obtained by refinement techniques.},

Over the years it has been extended to other formal specification languages and provides various constraint-based validation techniques. The tool itself was developed in SICStus Prolog, makes use of the finite domain library together with newly developed constraint solvers for booleans, sets, relations and sequences. The various solvers are linked via reification and Prolog co-routines. The overall challenge of ProB is to solve constraints in full predicate logic with arithmetic, set theory and higher-order relations and functions for safety critical applications. In addition to the tool development, we also provide details about various industrial applications of the tool as well as about our efforts in qualifying the tool for usage in safety critical contexts.

  ABSTRACT = {The state-based formal methods B and TLA+ share the common base of predicate logic, arithmetic and set theory. However, there are still considerable differences, such as the way to specify state transitions, the different approaches to typing, and the available tool support. In this paper, we present a translation from B to TLA+ to validate B specifications using the model checker TLC. We provide translation rules for almost all constructs of B, in particular for those which are not built-in in TLA+. The translation also includes many adaptations and optimizations to allow efficient checking by TLC. Moreover, we present a way to validate liveness properties for B specifications under fairness conditions. Our implemented translator, TLC4B, automatically translates a B specification to TLA+, invokes the model checker TLC, and translates the results back to B. We use ProB to double check the counter examples produced by TLC and replay them in the ProB animator. We also present a series of case studies and benchmark tests comparing TLC4B and ProB.},

The development was carried out using the Rodin platform and mainly used superposition refinement to structure the specification. To validate the model, we complemented proof with animation and model checking. For the latter, we used the ProB animator and model checker. Graphical representation of the model turned out to be crucial in the development and validation of the model; this was achieved using the visualization features provided by ProB and BMotion Studio. In addition, we discuss the positive and negative aspects of the Event-B language and tools which we encountered while working on the ABZ case study.},

As the ProB kernel is now capable of determining whether a search was exhaustive, one can also use the disprover as a prover. In this paper, we explain how ProB has been embedded as a prover into Rodin and Atelier B. Furthermore, we compare ProB with the standard automatic provers and SMT solvers used in Rodin. We demonstrate that constraint solving in general and ProB in particular are able to deal with classes of proof obligations that are not easily discharged by other provers and solvers. As benchmarks we use medium sized specifications such as landing gear systems, a CAN bus specification and a railway system. We also present a new method to check proof obligations for inconsistencies, which has helped uncover various issues in existing (sometimes fully proven) models.},

  ABSTRACT = {Most state-based formal methods, like B, Event-B or Z, provide support for static typing. However, these methods and the associated tools lack support for annotating variables with (physical) units of measurement. There is thus no obvious way to reason about correct or incorrect usage of such units. We present a technique that analyses the usage of physical units throughout B and Event-B machines, infers missing units and notifies the user of incorrectly handled units. The technique combines abstract interpretation with classical animation, constraint solving and model checking and has been integrated into the ProB validation tool, both for classical B and for Event-B. It provides source-level feedback about errors detected in the models. We also describe how to extend our approach to TLA+, an untyped formal language. We provide an in-depth empirical evaluation and demonstrate that our technique scales up to real-life industrial models.},

  ABSTRACT = {State space visualization is a popular technique for supporting the analysis of formal models. It often allows users to get a global view of the system and to identify structural similarities, symmetries, and unanticipated properties (only to name a few). However, state spaces typically become very large, so human inspection of the visualization becomes difficult. To overcome this challenge, we present an approach which can considerably reduce the size of the state space by creating projection diagrams. Moreover, we present an approach to link a projection diagram with a domain specific visualization. The projection diagram construction can be initiated directly from user-selected graphical elements, without the user having to write formulas or having to know the variables or internal structure of the model. This makes the projection diagram inspection and construction accessible to non-formal method experts. These techniques have been implemented within the ProB toolset, and we demonstrate their benefits and usefulness on several examples.},

An important aspect is detecting when enumeration was complete and if this has an impact on the soundness of the result. We present a technique which guarantees soundness in the following way: if the constraint solver finds a solution it is guaranteed to be correct; if the constraint solver fails to find a solution it can either return the result “definitely false” in case it knows enumeration was exhaustive, or “unknown” in case it was aborted. The technique can deal with nested universal and existential quantifiers. It can easily be extended to set comprehensions and other operators introducing new quantified variables. We show applications in data validation and proof.},

  ABSTRACT = {We present an integration of the constraint solving kernel of the ProB model checker with the SMT solver Z3. We apply the combined solver to B and Event-B predicates, featuring higher-order datatypes and constructs like set comprehensions. To do so we rely on the finite set logic of Z3 and provide a new translation from B to Z3, better suited for constraint solving. Predicates can then be solved by the two solvers working hand in hand: constraints are set up in both solvers simultaneously and (intermediate) results are transferred. We thus combine a constraint logic programming based solver with a DPLL(T) based solver into a single procedure. The improved constraint solver finds application in many validation tasks, from animation of implicit specifications, to test case generation, bounded and symbolic model checking on to disproving of proof obligations. We conclude with an empirical evaluation of our approach focusing on two dimensions: comparing low and high-level encodings of B as well as comparing pure ProB to ProB combined with Z3.},

  ABSTRACT = {We present a symbolic reachability analysis approach for B that can provide a significant speedup over traditional explicit state model checking. The symbolic analysis is implemented by linking ProB to LTSmin, a high-performance language independent model checker. The link is achieved via LTSmin's PINS interface, allowing ProB to benefit from LTSmin's analysis algorithms, while only writing a few hundred lines of glue-code, along with a bridge between ProB and C using ZeroMQ. ProB supports model checking of several formal specification languages such as B, Event-B, Z and TLA. Our experiments are based on a wide variety of B-Method and Event-B models to demonstrate the efficiency of the new link. Among the tested categories are state space generation and deadlock detection; but action detection and invariant checking are also feasible in principle. In many cases we observe speedups of several orders of magnitude. We also compare the results with other approaches for improving model checking, such as partial order reduction or symmetry reduction. We thus provide a new scalable, symbolic analysis algorithm for the B-Method and Event-B, along with a platform to integrate other model checking improvements via LTSmin in the future.

In this paper, we present our experiences on two real-world data validation projects from different domains which are based on the B language and use ProB as the central validation tool. The first project is the validation of university timetables, and the second project is the validation of railway topologies. Based on these two projects, we present a general structure of a data validation project in B and outline common challenges along with various solutions. We also discuss possible evolutions of the B language to make it (even) more suitable for such projects.},

@INPROCEEDINGS{FairnessPaper,
  ABSTRACT = {Model checking of liveness properties often results in unrealistic, unfair infinite behaviors as counterexamples. Fairness is a notion where the search is constrained to infinite paths that do not ignore infinitely the execution of a set of enabled actions. In this work we present an implementation for efficient checking of LTL formulas under strong and weak fairness in ProB, available for model checking B, Event-B, Z, CSP and CSP || B models. The fairness checking algorithm can cope with both weak and strong fairness conditions, where the respective fairness conditions can be joined by means of the logical operators for conjunction and disjunction, which makes setting up and checking fairness to a property more flexible. We evaluate the implementation on various CSP models and compare it to the fairness implementation of the PAT tool.},

  ABSTRACT = {Event-B provides a concise mathematical language for specifying invariants and guards. While both Event-B and Rodin matured, certain patterns for specifying properties like deadlock freedom emerged and are in use. These patterns are often realized by copy and paste of guards into other guards or invariants, leading to duplicated code and incomprehensible specifications. Furthermore, it may lead to errors if predicates are not kept in sync. We observed errors like these during the case studies of ABZ 2014 and started developing an extension to Event-B that allows accessing guards by corresponding event names. Since, it has been implemented as a plugin for the Rodin platform.},

Extensions to software model checking have been suggested and implemented and seem promising so far. However, using symbolic model checking algorithms for the specification languages B and Event-B is complicated. This is due to their high-level nature, which accounts for complex constraints. While some problems can be coped with by modifications to the algorithms, others relate to the heart of our tools: the constraint solver.},

  ABSTRACT = {Constraint solving technology for formal models has made considerable progress in the last years,
 and has lead to many applications such as animation of high-level specifications,
 test case generation, or symbolic model checking.
In this article we discuss the idea to use formal models themselves to express constraint satisfaction
 problems and to embed formal models as executable artefacts at runtime.
As part of our work, we have developed a document generation feature, whose output is derived from such executable models.
This present article has been generated using this feature, and we use the feature to showcase the suitability of formal modelling
 to express and solve various constraint solving benchmark examples.
We conclude with current limitations and open challenges of formal model-based constraint solving.},

  ABSTRACT={In this article, we present a concrete realisation of the ETCS Hybrid Level 3 concept, whose practical viability was evaluated in a field demonstration in 2017. Hybrid Level 3 (HL3) introduces Virtual Sub-Sections (VSS) as sub-divisions of classical track sections with Trackside Train Detection (TTD). Our approach introduces an add-on for the Radio Block Centre (RBC) of Thales, called Virtual Block Function (VBF), which computes the occupation states of the VSSs according to the HL3 concept using the train position reports, train integrity information, and the TTD occupation states. From the perspective of the RBC, the VBF behaves as an Interlocking (IXL) that transmits all signal aspects for virtual signals introduced for each VSS to the RBC. We report on the development of the VBF, implemented as a formal B model executed at runtime using ProB and successfully used in a field demonstration to control real trains.},

@INPROCEEDINGS{bsynthesis,
  ABSTRACT = {Writing a formal model is a complicated and time-consuming task. Usually, one successively refines a model with the help of proof, animation and model checking. In case an error such as an invariant violation is found, the model has to be adapted. However, finding the appropriate set of changes is often non-trivial. We propose to partially automate the process by combining synthesis with explicit model checking and implement it in the context of the B method: Guided by examples of positive and negative behavior, we strengthen preconditions of operations or relax invariants of the model appropriately. Moreover, by collecting initial examples from the user, we synthesize new operations from scratch or adapt existing ones. All this is done using user feedback, yielding an interactive assistant. In this paper, we present the foundations of this technique, its implementation using constraint solving for B, and illustrate the technique by synthesizing the formal model of a process scheduler.},

  ABSTRACT={Testing is an important aspect in professional software development, both to avoid and identify bugs as well as to increase maintainability. However, increasing the number of tests beyond a reasonable amount hinders development progress. To decide on the completeness of a test suite, many approaches to assert test coverage have been suggested. Yet, frameworks for logic programs remain scarce. In this paper, we introduce a framework for Prolog programs measuring test coverage using mutations. We elaborate on the main ideas of mutation testing  and transfer them to logic programs. To do so, we discuss the usefulness of different mutations in the context of Prolog and empirically evaluate them in a new mutation testing framework on different examples.},

@ARTICLE{prob_z3_cdclt,
  ABSTRACT = {ProB provides a constraint solver for the B-method written in Prolog and can make use of different backends based on SAT and SMT solving. One such backend translates B and Event-B operators to SMT-LIB using the Z3 solver. This translation uses quantifiers to axiomatize some operators, which are not well-handled by Z3. Several relational constraints such as the transitive closure are not supported by this translation. In this article, we substantially improve the translation to SMT-LIB by employing a more constructive rather than axiomatized style using Z3’s lambda function. Thereby, we are able both to translate more B and Event-B operators to SMT-LIB and improve the overall performance. We further extend ProB’s interface to Z3 to run different solver configurations in parallel. In addition, we present a direct implementation of SMT solving in Prolog using ProB’s constraint solver as a theory solver. We hereby aim to combine the strengths of conflict-driven clause learning for identifying contradictions with ProB’s constraint solver for finding solutions. We deem this implementation to be worthwhile since ProB’s constraint solver is tailored toward solving B and Event-B constraints, and we herewith avoid the dependency on an external SMT solver. Empirical results show that the new integration of Z3 has improved performance of constraint solving and enables to solve several constraints which cannot be solved by ProB’s constraint solver. Furthermore, the direct implementation of SMT solving in ProB shows benefits compared to ProB’s constraint solver and the integration of Z3.},
